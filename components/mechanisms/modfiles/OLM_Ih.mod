Ih current	 - hyperpolarization-activated nonspecific Na and K channel
		 - contributes to the resting membrane potential
		 - controls the afterhyperpolarization

		V1/2 = -84.1 mV
		   k = 10.2
		reversal potential = -32.9 +/- 1.1 mV

at -70 mV, currents were fitted by a single exponetial of t = 2.8+/- 0.76 s
at -120 mV, two exponentials were required, t1 = 186.3+/-33.6 ms 
t2 = 1.04+/-0.16 s

Deals with Ih in CA1 pyramidal cells.  Finds that conductance density
increases with distance from the soma.

soma g = 0.0013846 mho/cm2
dendrite g (300-350 um away) = 0.0125 mho/cm2
