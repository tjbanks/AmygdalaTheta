    #   known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.

    #   change over time (phase) we consider each small time interval (as determined by length of the timestep) 
    #   where the firing rate is constant.
    #
    #   For a given cell i and a given timestep t we model how many times cell i fires during timestep t
    #   using the poisson distribution with λ being set to the firing rate for cell i at time t (adjusted 
    #   to be the firing rate per milisecond, i.e. per timstep).
